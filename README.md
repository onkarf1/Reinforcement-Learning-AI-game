# Reinforcement-Learning-AI-game
This project involves training an AI agent to play a game consisting of a player, enemies, and a goal state. The objective of the agent is to navigate the player to reach the goal state while avoiding the enemies. The game is fully observable, meaning the agent has access to all relevant information about the game state.
